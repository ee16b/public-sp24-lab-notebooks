    "\n",
    "Creating planar circuits will not only help staff assist you better but will also allow you to more easy identify errors in your circuit, simplify debugging, and make your S1XT33N look absolutely stunning! Some tips to help you create planar circuits are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plan Your Circuit:** Before you start placing components on the breadboard, plan your circuit on paper or using circuit design software. This will help you understand the layout and connections needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Color-Coding:** Use colored wires or labels to differentiate between power, ground, and signal wires. This makes it easier to trace connections and troubleshoot issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cut and Bend Leads/Wires Properly:** Trim component leads (legs) and wires to an appropriate length, leaving enough to fit securely into the breadboard. Bend the leads at a right angle to ensure a snug fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test as You Go:** Don't wait until your entire circuit is assembled to test it. Test sections of the circuit as you add components to catch and fix problems early.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Guidelines\n",
    "- Make sure you use consistent colors for ground, power voltages, etc. Black is usually reserved for GND, and red for power.\n",
    "- In general, it's better to have shorter wires, so that it's easier to follow and debug. Feel free to use the wire strippers to adjust the wire lengths.\n",
    "- The + and - rails are reserved for power and GND, respectively. Avoid connecting any other signals to those rails. You will be connecting the power supply leads to your breadboard rails.\n",
    "- **Make sure you connect all of your grounds**, including the lab equipments' grounds, to the negative (-) rails on your breadboards. Add a wire between the two - rails so that everything in your circuit references the same ground. Only connect your + rails when you want them to carry the same voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LEDs\n",
    "- **LEDs have polarity, meaning the direction you plug it into the circuit matters**. If you reverse the direction of the LED, the current will not be able to flow and the LED will not light up.\n",
    "- The anode (+) is the longer/crooked leg of the LED, while the cathode (-) is the shorter/straight leg of the LED.\n",
    "- **Make sure you connect the LED to the correct voltage source**. If you connect the LED to a voltage source that is too high, the LED will burn out and break. If you connect the LED to a voltage source that is too low, the LED will not light up.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"width: 300px\" src=\"images/diode.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For further guidelines on breadboarding and debugging, refer to the [debugging guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vDHFBkp0fljjbVocPHC06VmMty2lqHTo/view?usp=sharing) or the [intro to circuits playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhIxXDRJ9_VqxwlybfFHzihu1e3-Ll433).\n",

    "$A_v$ is a ratio of how much bigger the output is compared to the input, and so has no units. Note that if the input is inverted, the gain is a __negative__ number.\n",

Given an op-amp amplifier circuit with gain $A_v$ (can be positive or negative) and an input sinusoidal wave with DC offset $b$ and maximum amplitude $a$, what are the most restrictive values of $V_{DD}$ and $V_{SS}$ for the op-amp such that the output is not distorted?** Assume NO virtual ground and provide answers for both $A_v < 0$ and $A_v > 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. An inverting amplifier with no reference voltage (non-inverting terminal is connected to GND) is shown in the following figure. Show all of your work.**\n",
    "<img style=\"width: 600px\" src=\"images/inverting_amplifier.png\">\n",
    "- a. Assume the op-amp has a **finite** gain $A$. Derive the amplifier gain $\\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}$ in terms of ${R_{in}}$, ${R_{f}}$, and $A$. (Hint: voltage dividers will be useful here.)\n",
    "- b. Assume the op-amp gain is now **infinite**. Using this information, simplify the expression for the amplifier gain you derived in part (a). **Explain why your simplified expression makes sense.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What are the ideal gain and measured gain of the op-amp circuit in Lab 1? Are there any discrepancies between these two values? Why or why not?**"
