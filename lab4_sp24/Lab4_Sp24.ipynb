You also built a 5V voltage regulator circuit to power the circuits so that S1XT33N can freely roam on the ground. Our end goal is to have S1XT33N be voice-controlled, and in order to do that, we need a way for S1XT33N to listen to what you're saying.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Materials:\n",
    "- Phone speaker or headphones\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "1. Connect your oscilloscope probe to $V_{out}$ on your mic board.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add a **peak-to-peak** measurement for the oscilloscope channel you're using to probe your mic board output. Additionally, we recommend you set the horizontal time scale to about 5-10 ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Play a pure tone using a [tone generator](https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/) in the range (1500 - 2000 Hz)** on your phone at a reasonable volume (leaning towards the soft side). Do NOT use a Youtube video!\n",
    "    - If the tone generator website is not working for you, you can download a tone generator app onto your phone instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Make sure to point the speaker directly at the mic and hold it a few inches away from the mic. The distance between your speaker and the mic significantly affects the tuning process, so **try to keep the distance between your phone and speaker consistent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Turn the potentiometer on the mic board **(CW: decrease amplitude | CCW: increase amplitude)** using a screwdriver until you see a sine wave with a **peak-to-peak of around 1.5V to 2V** on the oscilloscope. **The sine wave should be centered at around 2.5V.**\n",
    "    - **The potentiometer is a multiturn potentiometer, so you will have to turn it A LOT before you will notice any changes.** However, note that the tuning screw is very sensitive near the target voltage range.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Verify that the frequency of the measured sine wave matches the tone from your phone using your oscilloscope by adding a **frequency** measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes:\n",
    "- With oscillating signals like this, there is an important concept called \"railing.\" We define railing, with regards to this mic board, as non-linear behavior at the boundaries of the output range that results from the op-amp on the mic board being limited by its VDD and VSS, rendering it unable to output the entire output range. If you see flat edges/lines on either the top or bottom of the waveform instead of the smooth peaks and troughs of the sine wave, which happens if you have $V_{pp} \\geq 5V$, your mic board is railing, and you need to reduce the amplitude of the mic board output.\n",

    "|<img style=\"width:500px\" src=\"images/not_railing.jpg\">|<img style=\"width:500px\" src=\"images/railing.jpg\">|\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a sanity check: Tap on the mic and ensure that it rails. However, **it should not be railing while you play the tone.**\n",
    "- **DO NOT use autoscale on the oscilloscope!** It will not work well with our mic board signal because the signal varies very rapidly. Using autoscale often sets the timescale to a few nanoseconds, which is too small of a timescale to see anything of importance or value for us.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that we are finding the frequency response of our joint speaker-microphone system, not just that of our microphone. You can think of our system as your speaker (which is playing the pure tones) in series with your microphone (which is receiving the pure tones) and outputting some voltage corresponding to those pure tones. We are measuring this cascaded system's reactions to certain frequency inputs.\n",
