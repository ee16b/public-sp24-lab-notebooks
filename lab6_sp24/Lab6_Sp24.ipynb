A good choice of target velocity is the midpoint of the overlapping range of velocity. The below cell will calculate this. We will use this value in the next lab, along with the $\\theta$ and $\\beta$ values calculated earlier for both wheels."

In other words, the velocity vs. PWM input curves for both wheels shift down by some value $v_o$, where $v_o$ is non-negative and increases as the battery power gets lower. If we still aim for the same operating point velocity and use the same linear model, how will the car's performance change as the battery level decreases?**"
