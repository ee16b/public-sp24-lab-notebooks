    "In the previous lab, you learned how microcontrollers like Arduinos interact with the world via DACs and ADCs. With that knowledge, we can now begin working on our project, which will use the Arduino as its \"brain\" or core. For the rest of this semester, you will be designing S1XT33N, a mischievous little robot who might just do what you want - if you design it correctly. Our end goal is to have S1XT33N listen to your voice commands and execute the corresponding drive command. In this lab, you will build S1XT33N’s legs: the motor control circuits that enable S1XT33N to move around, and the encoder circuits that enable your Arduino to detect how far and fast S1XT33N has moved. You will also be building the 5V regulator, which we will use to power the front-end circuits separately from the power supply so that S1XT33N can move freely on the ground (in Lab 6).\n",

    "This lab's motor controller and encoder circuits correspond to the purple sections on the project breadboard layout below, while the 5V regulator circuit corresponds to the teal section. **We strongly recommend that you follow this layout as you build the different circuits for S1XT33N.** In later labs, you will need room for the project circuits currently grayed out. The motor/encoder circuits require the 5V rail, which provides 5V to many of the front-end circuits for this car, and the `Motor 9V Rail`, which provides 9V to the motors. In this lab, the `Motor 9V Rail` and `Regulator 9V Rail` are powered by the power supply while the 5V rail is initially powered by the power supply, then by the 5V voltage regulator in Part 2. In future labs, the `Motor 9V Rail` and `Regulator 9V Rail` will be powered by two separate 9V batteries. **For all parts of the project, make sure to connect the two negative rails for GND and the two positive rails for the 5V rail** so that both sides of the breadboard can easily access the same ground and 5V.\n",

    "7. If you open up the serial monitor (Tools -> Serial Monitor), make sure to set the specified baud rate in the code. You'll see the baud rate under something like ```Serial.begin(38400)```, where 38400 is the baud rate if it is not defined at the top of the file.\n",

    "1. Connect the node labeled **<span style=\"color:#ba190f\">Arduino Pin 6</span>** in one of the motor controller circuits to **<span style=\"color:#ba190f\">pin 6</span>** on your Arduino. **Make sure to ground your Arduino** (connect any Arduino GND pin to the negative rail of breadboard)! There should be **no** other connections between your project breadboard and the Arduino aside from pin `6` and GND. Turn on the power supply output.\n",
    "      - If pin `6` is no longer functional, any free pins of `5`, `10`, `11`, or `13` will also work. If you're using one of these other pins, you'll have to update the pin definition at the top of the `motor_test.ino` code to reflect that.\n",
    "2. Upload `motor_test.ino` to your Arduino and hit `RST`.\n",
    "3. Open the Serial Monitor (`CTRL-SHIFT-L` / `CMD-SHIFT-L`). Set the baud rate to **38400**.\n",

    "- The motor is reversible so connect it in any direction for now. If it turns out to go backwards later, just exchange the two wires of the motor.\n",
    "- If one motor is working but the other isn’t, try plugging the nonfunctional one into the functional motor’s motor circuit to isolate if the issue is the motor circuit or the motor. \n",
    "- If you think the motor is the issue, you can try putting 9V across the motor seperate from the motor circuit to see if it moves.\n",
    "- If your motor is not moving, we want to isolate the problem. You can try the following steps. \n",
    "    1. Make sure the switch is on and that the power supply is on. Probe the cathode terminal of the diode— if the switch is on, this should always be at 9V.\n",
    "    2. Ensure the diode and BJT are plugged in facing the right direction.\n",
    "    3. Probing where pin `6` is plugged in with the oscilloscope will allow you to check whether there is a PWM signal varying between 0V and 5V reaching the breadboard. The signal should vary based on the duty cycle printed on the Serial Monitor. If there is no PWM signal, your jumper cable or Arduino pin might be at fault. If you encounter multiple faulty jumper cables, call your TA over.\n",
    "    4. Probe the anode terminal of the diode. When the motors are not moving, this should be at 9V (providing 0V across the motor). As the duty cycle changes, you should see this voltage change, causing the motors to move. If this is not the case, your BJT circuit or diode may be broken."

    "In general, there are two major types of error in sensing the car's trajectory. The first is noise in the sensor signals. The second is from mechanical differences between the two sides of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will test for and fix the first type of noise. The mechanical type primarily affects performance over long distances, which we will compensate for  after implementing closed-loop control in Lab 7.\n",

    "- Car with encoders and motors installed\n",
    "- 2 plastic encoder wheels (black plastic wheel with lots of rectangular holes)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks: \n",
    "1. Connect the Arduino's USB.\n",
    "2. Make sure one of the ground pins on the Arduino is connected to the ground rail of your project breadboard.\n",
    "3. **Connect the input resistor of the left motor's driver circuit to pin `6` and the input resistor of the right motor's driver circuit to pin `5`.** The input resistor is the 1.5k resistor in each motor controller circuit. The Arduino pin connects to the end not connected to the base pin of the BJT.\n",
    "4. Turn on the power supply output. <span style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold\">Change the current limit back to 0.4A to power the motors.</span> **If your encoders are powered properly, the LEDs on each one should blink when you pass something through the encoders or turn the wheels.**\n",
    "5. If you haven't already, attach the encoder wheels as shown below.\n",
    "    - If it is on, make sure to remove the paper sticker from your car frame if there is one (yes, it does come off) before you attach the encoders.\n",

    "    - The test will conduct 4 phases: both wheels at rest, only left wheel driving, only right wheel driving, and both wheels driving.\n",
    "    - If your encoders are functioning properly, the serial monitor should print \"Failure if encoder wheels are off. Success if encoder wheels are on.\" after each phase.\n",
    "    - This diagnostics message will be followed up by a long and repeating string of the actual values measured during the duration of the program. If you want to look at just the encoder diagnostics, make sure to untick `Autoscroll` in the bottom left of the Serial Monitor window.\n",
    "    - If the actual values measured are noisy (e.g. there are non-zero readings on the right wheel when only the left wheel is turning, or unusually high, in the thousands), **you may need to add the 10nF denoising capacitors to your encoder circuits**. Disconnect the ground end of your 2k resistors, and place them in series with one capacitor each. The other end of each capacitor will go to ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging Tips:\n",
    "- If your `encoder_test_0_ticks.ino` test is not passing, there could be several issues:\n",
    "    1. Ensure that your encoders are turned on by turning the wheels by hand **slowly** with the encoder wheels on. The red encoder lights should flash. Additionally, the signal from the encoder `S` pin should alternate between 0V when the light is on and 5V when the light is off. If the light stays off or there is no output from the `S` pin, ensure that the encoder pin `V` is receiving 5V and `G` is plugged into GND by probing your rails. Ensure your encoder wheels are on. If this doesn't work or the lights only stay on, it could be that your encoder is broken or your jumper wires are faulty.\n",
    "    3. If the above is not working, it is likely your jumper wire or Arduino pin is the issue. If you encounter multiple faulty jumper cables, call your TA over."
