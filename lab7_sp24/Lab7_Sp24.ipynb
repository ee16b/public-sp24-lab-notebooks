    " Our implementations of data collection and control loop have different time periods: data collection collected data on half-second intervals, while our controller updates the trajectory every 0.1 seconds. This means that our controller will be running at a faster rate than our data collection. However, our definition of the time step is dependent on the sampling period we use, so we will need to account for this difference by adjusting $v^*$ in our implementation of turning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the sampling periods of the control loop and the data collection be $T_c$ and $T_d$, which have the units $\\frac{s}{sample}$. Therefore,their respective sampling frequencies $F_c = \\frac{1}{T_c}$ and $F_d = \\frac{1}{T_d}$ have the units $\\frac{samples}{s}$. We define $m=\\frac{F_c}{F_d}$, the ratio of the sampling frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our controller will interpret velocity in terms of distance traveled (measured in encoder ticks) per sample ($\\frac{ticks}{sample}$). However, we need to ensure the car is travelling at the same ground velocity, which is measured per second ($\\frac{ticks}{s}$). To get a constant $\\frac{ticks}{s}$, we need $v^*_c \\cdot F_c = v^* \\cdot F_d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $v^*_c$, we get $v^*_c = v^* \\cdot \\frac{F_d}{F_c} = \\frac{v^*}{m}$\n",

    "During data collection, we sampled every $.5$ seconds. If our $v^*$ was collected to be $100$ ticks/sample, this means that we expect our car to move $100$ ticks every $.5s$ (assuming constant velocity). Now, our controller's sampling rate is instead $.1$ seconds. If we use the same $v^*$ of $100$ ticks/sample, we are now expecting our car to move $100$ ticks in $.1s$, effectively quintupling our velocity! Our controller does not have information about the original sampling period; to account for this, we divide $v^*$ by $5$ when using a $v^*$ value for turning.\n",

However, some cars may still turn very slightly even when both encoder measurements are exactly the same ($\\delta=constant$). This can be caused by mechanical issues such as axle wobble or mismatch in the wheel sizes. In this case, since the car thinks it's driving straight, it's the best we can do using just the sensors in our control system.\n",
